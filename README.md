This is a simple but highly effective high yield farming bot that has a stop loss function. 
This bot thrives on volatility , the minute volatility is detected it pulls from the yield and sells everything to a stable coin then it waits for the market to stabilize sells the stable coins and goes back to yield farming.
I made this YouTube video on how to configure it and run it
